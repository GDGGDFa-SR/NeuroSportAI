A neuroimaging-enhanced AI framework for personalized sports training optimization and injury prevention through multimodal data fusion and deep learning.

## Overview

Neuroimaging has become a cornerstone of sports science, offering deep insights into brain activity, cognitive-motor coordination, and injury mechanisms. However, traditional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and DTI often struggle with low temporal resolution, motion sensitivity, and limited real-world applicability.

To address these challenges, this project introduces a novel framework that integrates advanced neuroimaging analysis with AI-powered recommendation systems to optimize athletic training and proactively prevent injuries.

Our system includes two main components:

- **NeuroAthleteNet**: A deep learning model for extracting spatiotemporal neural features and analyzing brain connectivity using graph-based techniques.
- **NeuroSportSync**: A multimodal fusion module that aligns neuroimaging data with real-time biomechanical and physiological signals for comprehensive performance modeling.
